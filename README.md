# GraphQL using Apollo Server and Express

Exercises from this book: https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-graphql-book
..and from this tutorial: https://www.robinwieruch.de/graphql-apollo-server-tutorial

Started with Simple Node Application: https://github.com/johnnyoshika/minimal-node-application

## Setup
* Use Node version 8+ (e.g. v8.17.0)
* `npm install`
* Postgres
  * `docker pull postgres`
  * `docker run --name graphql -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e POSTGRES_DB=apollo -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`
  * attach and use psql: `docker exec -it graphql psql -h localhost -U postgres -d apollo`
  * psql commands:
    * `\l` list databases
    * `\c {database name}` switch database
    * `\dt` list tables
    * `select * from users;` list users (only available after database is synced and seeded on application startup)
    * `select * from messages;` list messages (only available after database is synced and seeded on application startup)
    * `select * from messages where "text" like '%ultimate%';` this works
    * `select * from messages where text like '%ultimate%';` this also works
    * `select * from messages where "userId" = 1;` this works
    * `select * from messages where userId = 1;` this doesn't
    * `SELECT "id", "text", "createdAt", "updatedAt", "userId" FROM "messages" AS "message" WHERE "message"."id" = '5';` query generated by Sequelize
    * `\d messages` details about messages columns
    * <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd> -> quit
  * `docker stop graphql` stop container
  * `docker start graphql` start container
  * `docker rm graphql` remove container

## Run
* `npm start`
* Open http://localhost:8000/graphql

## Debugging in VS Code

Borrowed from: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/nodemon

_Note: Debugging works best after installing and running a long running task, such as **Express** web server. VS Code automatically re-attaches to a newly spanned Node process whenever files change, but because this default console app immediately ends its process, VS Code doesn't have enough time to re-attach reliably._

* Terminal:
  * `npm run debug`
* VS Code:
  * Go to the Debug view and select `Node: Nodemon` configuration
  * Start the debugger with <kbd>F5</kbd>
  * VS Code should list all of the running node processes. Select `nodemon --exec babel-node --inspect src/index.js`

  * Set a breakpoint and it should now be hit
